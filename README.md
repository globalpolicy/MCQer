Scrape online sources of MCQ for competitive exams

This is a simple .NET 8 program that scrapes online sources of Multiple Choice Questions and consolidates them into a SQLite database.
Currently, it only works for Civil Engineering related questions from IndiaBix for a select few categories I found to be relevant to me, but this behavior can be changed and extended in code without much trouble.

Checkout the attached screenshot for the structure of the DB table:
